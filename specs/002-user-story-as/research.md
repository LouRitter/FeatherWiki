# Research: Enhanced Theming System with Color Pickers

## CSS Custom Properties Enhancement Strategy

**Decision**: Extend existing CSS Custom Properties system to include all UI elements with comprehensive variable coverage.

**Rationale**: 
- Builds upon existing theming foundation from previous implementation
- Ensures consistent theming across all UI components
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing themes
- Provides comprehensive coverage for sidebar, active states, and code blocks

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete CSS rewrite: Rejected due to complexity and risk of breaking existing functionality
- Selective theming: Rejected as it would leave some UI elements unthemed
- External theming system: Rejected due to violation of self-containment principle

## Color Picker UI Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: Replace textarea-based theme editing with native HTML color picker interface.

**Rationale**:
- Provides intuitive visual interface for color selection
- Eliminates need for users to understand CSS syntax
- Native browser support ensures compatibility
- Reduces user errors in color specification

**Alternatives considered**:
- Third-party color picker libraries: Rejected due to file size impact and dependency concerns
- Custom color picker implementation: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead
- Hybrid approach (textarea + pickers): Rejected as it would increase UI complexity

## Live Preview Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: Implement real-time color updates with immediate visual feedback during editing.

**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate visual feedback for better user experience
- Allows users to see changes before committing to save
- Integrates seamlessly with existing theme application system
- Maintains performance with no strict timing requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Preview-only mode: Rejected as it would require separate preview mechanism
- Delayed preview: Rejected as it would reduce user experience quality
- No live preview: Rejected as it would make theme creation less intuitive

## Theme Selection Workflow Strategy

**Decision**: Implement dropdown-based theme selection before showing color pickers.

**Rationale**:
- Clear workflow for users to select which theme to edit
- Prevents accidental editing of wrong themes
- Maintains existing theme management patterns
- Provides clear visual indication of current editing context

**Alternatives considered**:
- Always edit active theme: Rejected as it would limit editing flexibility
- Edit all themes simultaneously: Rejected due to UI complexity
- Tab-based interface: Rejected due to space constraints and complexity

## Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Accept invalid colors but display warning messages to guide users.

**Rationale**:
- Maintains user workflow continuity
- Provides helpful feedback without blocking progress
- Allows for experimental color values
- Aligns with browser color picker behavior

**Alternatives considered**:
- Strict validation with rejection: Rejected as it would interrupt user workflow
- Silent acceptance: Rejected as it would not provide user guidance
- Automatic color correction: Rejected due to complexity and potential user confusion

## Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: No strict timing requirements for live preview updates.

**Rationale**:
- CSS variable changes are inherently fast in modern browsers
- Focus on correctness and user experience over micro-optimization
- Maintains flexibility for different hardware capabilities
- Aligns with FeatherWiki's minimalist philosophy

**Alternatives considered**:
- Strict sub-100ms requirement: Rejected as unnecessary constraint
- Performance monitoring: Rejected due to complexity
- Optimized update batching: Rejected as premature optimization
