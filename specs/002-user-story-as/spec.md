# Feature Specification: Enhanced Theming System with Color Pickers

**Feature Branch**: `002-user-story-as`  
**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "user_story: >
  As a FeatherWiki user, I want to theme all parts of the UI, including the sidebar and active elements which are not currently effected by the theme, using an intuitive color picker, so I can easily create and share comprehensive custom themes.

requirements:
  - id: REQ-CSS-02
    description: >
      A comprehensive refactor of `index.css` is required to eliminate all remaining hardcoded color values. New CSS Custom Properties (variables) MUST be introduced for UI elements like the sidebar, active/selected states, and code blocks. All variables MUST have a fallback value.
    target_file: \"index.css\"
    suggested new_variables:
      - \"--sidebar-bg: #ddd\"
      - \"--sidebar-text-color: #000\"
      - \"--active-element-bg: #87C\"
      - \"--active-element-text: #fff\"
      - \"--danger-bg: red\"
      - \"--code-bg: #eee\"
MAY NOT BE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF CLASSES THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED

  - id: REQ-UI-02
    description: >
      The theme editor UI in `views/settings.js` MUST be replaced. The existing `<textarea>` for manual CSS entry MUST be removed and substituted with a user-friendly interface composed of labeled `<input type=\"color\">` elements for core theme properties. the existing alert to set theme properties should be removed
    target_file: \"views/settings.js\"
    ui_map:
      - { label_key: \"themePrimaryBg\", variable: \"--bg-primary\" }
      - { label_key: \"themeTextMain\", variable: \"--text-main\" }
      - { label_key: \"themeAccent\", variable: \"--accent-color\" }
      - { label_key: \"themeSidebarBg\", variable: \"--sidebar-bg\" }
      - { label_key: \"themeActiveElementBg\", variable: \"--active-element-bg\" }

  - id: REQ-LOGIC-02
    description: >
      The event handling logic for the theme editor in `views/settings.js` MUST be updated to support a live-preview workflow with the new color picker UI.
    target_file: \"views/settings.js\"
    spec:
      - \"The `oninput` event for each `<input type='color'>` MUST update the corresponding variable in the `state.p.themes` object for the selected theme.\"
      - \"The `oninput` event handler MUST then immediately call the `applyActiveTheme()` function to reflect the color change live in the UI.\"
      - \"The `onchange` event (triggered when the color picker is closed) MUST emit the `events.CHECK_CHANGED` event to mark the wiki as needing a save.\"
      - \"The 'Save Theme' button MUST be removed, as saving is now handled by the main 'Save Wiki' flow.\"

  - id: REQ-I18N-02
    description: >
      New translation keys for the color picker labels MUST be added to `locales/en-US.json`.
    target_file: \"locales/en-US.json\"
    keys_to_add:
      - { key: \"themePrimaryBg\", value: \"Primary Background\" }
      - { key: \"themeTextMain\", value: \"Main Text\" }
      - { key: \"themeAccent\", value: \"Accent / Links\" }
      - { key: \"themeSidebarBg\", value: \"Sidebar Background\" }
      - { key: \"themeActiveElementBg\", value: \"Active Element Background\" }

definition_of_done:
  - All requirements (REQ-CSS-02, REQ-UI-02, REQ-LOGIC-02, REQ-I18N-02) are implemented.
  - All acceptance criteria are met.
  - No regressions are introduced to existing functionality, especially server-saving.
  - The implementation remains compliant with the FeatherWiki SpecKit Constitution.

acceptance_criteria:
  - criteria: \"GIVEN a theme is selected for editing, WHEN I use the 'Sidebar Background' color picker, THEN the sidebar's background color changes in real-time.\"
  - criteria: \"GIVEN a theme is selected, WHEN I use the 'Active Element Background' color picker, THEN the background color of the currently active tab (e.g., 'Pages') changes in real-time.\"
  - criteria: \"GIVEN I change a color using a color picker, WHEN I close the picker, THEN the main 'Save Wiki' button becomes highlighted, indicating unsaved changes.\"
  - criteria: \"GIVEN I have set a custom sidebar color and save the wiki, WHEN I reload the saved file, THEN the custom sidebar color is applied on load.\"
  - criteria: \"GIVEN I inspect the new UI in the settings page, THEN all labels for the color pickers are sourced from the translation file.\""

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-07
- Q: How should users select which theme to edit when using the color picker interface? ‚Üí A: Provide a dropdown to select which theme to edit before showing color pickers
- Q: What should happen when a user enters an invalid color value in a color picker? ‚Üí A: Accept the color but show a warning message
- Q: Should the live preview apply changes to the currently active theme or only to the theme being edited? ‚Üí A: Apply changes to the currently active theme if it matches the edited theme
- Q: When creating a new theme, should the color pickers start with default values or inherit from the currently active theme? ‚Üí A: Allow user to choose the starting point (default, current, or neutral)
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable delay for live preview updates when using color pickers? ‚Üí A: No limit on delay

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a FeatherWiki user, I want to theme all parts of the UI, including the sidebar and active elements which are not currently affected by the theme, using an intuitive color picker, so I can easily create and share comprehensive custom themes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am in the theme editor, **When** I select a theme from the dropdown, **Then** color pickers appear for that theme's properties
2. **Given** I have selected a theme for editing, **When** I use the "Sidebar Background" color picker, **Then** the sidebar's background color changes in real-time
3. **Given** I have selected a theme for editing, **When** I use the "Active Element Background" color picker, **Then** the background color of the currently active tab changes in real-time
4. **Given** I change a color using a color picker, **When** I close the picker, **Then** the main "Save Wiki" button becomes highlighted, indicating unsaved changes
5. **Given** I have set custom colors and save the wiki, **When** I reload the saved file, **Then** all custom colors are applied on load
6. **Given** I am viewing the theme editor, **When** I inspect the UI, **Then** all labels for the color pickers are sourced from the translation file
7. **Given** I want to create a new theme, **When** I select "Create New Theme", **Then** I can choose a starting point (default, current, or neutral) and see color pickers for all themeable UI elements
8. **Given** I am editing an existing theme, **When** I change colors using the pickers, **Then** the changes are immediately visible across the entire UI

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to use an invalid color value in a color picker? ‚Üí System accepts the color but displays a warning message
- How does the system handle color picker changes when no theme is selected for editing?
- What occurs when a user closes the color picker without making changes?
- How does the system behave when the live preview fails to apply a color change?
- What happens if the color picker UI becomes unresponsive during theme editing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide color picker interface for all themeable UI elements including sidebar, active states, and code blocks
- **FR-002**: System MUST update theme colors in real-time as users interact with color pickers, applying changes to the currently active theme if it matches the theme being edited
- **FR-003**: System MUST eliminate all hardcoded color values in favor of CSS Custom Properties with fallback values
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate color picker changes with the existing save/load workflow
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide intuitive labels for all color picker controls using translation keys
- **FR-006**: System MUST remove the manual CSS textarea interface in favor of color pickers
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply color changes immediately to provide live preview functionality
- **FR-008**: System MUST mark the wiki as needing a save when color picker changes are made
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist all color picker selections in the theme data structure
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing themes created using the textarea interface
- **FR-011**: System MUST support theming of previously hardcoded UI elements (sidebar, active states, code blocks)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide fallback colors for all new CSS Custom Properties to ensure functionality

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Color Picker Configuration**: Defines which UI elements have color pickers and their corresponding CSS variables
- **Live Preview State**: Tracks real-time color changes during theme editing without requiring save operations
- **Enhanced Theme Data**: Extended theme object structure that includes all new CSS Custom Properties for comprehensive UI theming
