# Feature Specification: FeatherWiki Theming Engine

**Feature Branch**: `001-featherwiki-theming-engine`  
**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "# FeatherWiki Theming Engine Implementation Plan

user_story: >
  As a FeatherWiki user, I want to create, manage, and apply visual themes
  to my wiki, so that I can personalize its appearance and improve readability.

requirements:
  - id: REQ-CSS-01
    description: >
      Refactor the entire `index.css` file to use CSS Custom Properties (variables)
      for all colors, backgrounds, fonts, and key spacing values. Every variable
      MUST have a fallback value.
      Example: `background: #fff;` becomes `background: var(--bg-primary, #fff);`

  - id: REQ-STATE-01
    description: >
      Modify `initState.js` to augment the core data object `state.p`. The object
      MUST be extended with two new keys: `themes` (initialized to `{}`) and
      `activeTheme` (initialized to `'default'`).

  - id: REQ-LOGIC-01
    description: >
      Implement a theme application function in `initEmitter.js`. This function MUST:
      1. Run on the `ONLOAD` event and when the active theme is changed.
      2. Read the `state.p.activeTheme` and `state.p.themes` objects.
      3. Dynamically generate and inject a `<style id='fw-theme'>` element into the
         document `<head>` containing a `:root` block with the theme's variables.
      4. Remove any pre-existing `<style id='fw-theme'>` element before injection to
         prevent conflicts.

  - id: REQ-UI-01
    description: >
      Create a "Theming" section within the `views/settings.js` view. This section MUST contain:
      1. A `<select>` dropdown to set `state.p.activeTheme`.
      2. UI controls (inputs, buttons) to create, rename, and delete themes stored in `state.p.themes`.
      3. A `<textarea>` to edit the CSS variable key-value pairs for a selected theme.
      4. All UI interactions that modify theme data MUST emit the `events.CHECK_CHANGED` event.

  - id: REQ-I18N-01
    description: >
      All new user-facing text strings introduced by the UI in REQ-UI-01 MUST be
      added as keys to `locales/en-US.json` for internationalization.

definition_of_done:
  - All functional and non-functional requirements listed above are implemented.
  - All acceptance criteria are met without regression to existing functionality.
  - The implementation is fully compliant with the FeatherWiki SpecKit Constitution, particularly the principles of Parsimony and Self-Containment.
  - The final code is merged into the main repository branch.

acceptance_criteria:
  - criteria: "GIVEN the wiki is loaded, WHEN I inspect the DOM in the settings view, THEN a new 'Theming' section is present."
  - criteria: "GIVEN I am in the Theming section, WHEN I create a new theme named 'dark_mode' with the content '--bg-primary: #000;', THEN the `state.p.themes` object contains a `dark_mode` key with the corresponding value."
  - criteria: "GIVEN I have created the 'dark_mode' theme, WHEN I select it from the 'Active Theme' dropdown, THEN the wiki's background color immediately changes to black."
  - criteria: "GIVEN the 'dark_mode' theme is active, WHEN I save the wiki, open the newly downloaded file, THEN the wiki loads with the 'dark_mode' theme applied by default."
  - criteria: "GIVEN I delete the 'dark_mode' theme, WHEN I inspect the `state.p.themes` object, THEN the `dark_mode` key no longer exists."
  - criteria: "GIVEN the theming UI is visible, WHEN I view the source, THEN all labels and text are sourced from translatable keys (e.g., `{{translate:activeTheme}}`)."
  - criteria: "GIVEN an older FeatherWiki file is imported without theme data, WHEN it loads, THEN it MUST render correctly using the default fallback theme without errors.""

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-07
- Q: What are the specific validation rules for theme names to prevent conflicts and ensure data integrity? ‚Üí A: Allow any valid CSS identifier format (letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores)
- Q: When a user enters invalid CSS syntax in the theme editor, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Reject the entire theme save and show error message
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable time for theme changes to be visually applied? ‚Üí A: No strict requirements
- Q: When a user tries to delete the currently active theme, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Allow deletion but require user to select new active theme first
- Q: Is there a limit on how many custom themes a user can create? ‚Üí A: Maximum 10 themes per wiki

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a FeatherWiki user, I want to create, manage, and apply visual themes to my wiki, so that I can personalize its appearance and improve readability for different use cases and preferences.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing the FeatherWiki settings page, **When** I navigate to the Theming section, **Then** I can see controls to manage themes and select an active theme
2. **Given** I want to create a new theme, **When** I enter a theme name and CSS variables, **Then** the theme is saved and becomes available for selection
3. **Given** I have multiple themes available, **When** I select a different theme from the dropdown, **Then** the wiki's appearance immediately updates to reflect the new theme
4. **Given** I have applied a custom theme, **When** I save the wiki file, **Then** the theme persists and loads automatically when I reopen the file
5. **Given** I want to modify an existing theme, **When** I edit the CSS variables in the textarea, **Then** the changes are saved and applied immediately
6. **Given** I no longer need a theme, **When** I delete it from the theme management interface, **Then** the theme is removed and no longer available for selection

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create a theme with an invalid CSS syntax? ‚Üí System rejects the entire theme save and displays an error message
- How does the system handle theme selection when the selected theme no longer exists?
- What occurs when a user imports an older FeatherWiki file that doesn't have theme data?
- How does the system behave when CSS variables reference non-existent values?
- What happens if the theming system fails to load or apply a theme?
- What happens when a user tries to delete the currently active theme? ‚Üí System requires user to select a new active theme before allowing deletion
- What happens when a user tries to create more than 10 themes? ‚Üí System prevents creation and shows limit reached message

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
