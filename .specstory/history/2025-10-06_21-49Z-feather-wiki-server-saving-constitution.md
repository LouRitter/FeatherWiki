# Feather Wiki server-saving constitution (2025-10-06 21:49Z)

_**User (2025-10-06 21:49Z)**_

/constitution  Constitution: Feather Wiki Server-Saving Preservation
Mission: Maintain Feather Wiki's self-contained, single-file architecture and server-saving functionality without regression.
I. Self-Containment (Quine Mandate)

All data MUST serialize to JSON within the wiki data object (state.p)
The wiki MUST remain a portable single HTML file that works anywhere without external dependencies
Features MUST NOT require external databases or server-side files beyond the defined server-save mechanism

II. Server-Save Protocol

Server detection: OPTIONS request checks for dav header (any value)
When dav present: Display "Save Wiki to Server" button above "Save Wiki Locally"
When dav absent: Local saving only
Save operation: PUT request to same address with complete HTML output (unmodified)
Response handling:

Success → "Saved."
Failure with body text → display error message
Failure without body → "Save Failed! Status [code]."


Authentication: Support server-side auth (cookie/HTTP basic) without implementing conflicting client-side auth

III. Size & Efficiency (Parsimony Mandate)

Write minimal, clean vanilla JavaScript (ES2015+)
Reuse existing styles (index.css) and functions (FW global object) before adding new ones
Zero core dependencies—external libraries load dynamically via CDN when needed

Prohibited Breaking Changes:

OPTIONS/PUT request format or header detection
HTML output modification during save
Button labels, display order, or message formats

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

Constitution: Feather Wiki Server-Saving Preservation

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     * MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     * MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     * PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.
   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.

5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

6. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

8. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).

Formatting & Style Requirements:
- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.

+ 
+ ## Development Workflow
+ 
+ All features must maintain the self-contained architecture. New functionality should be evaluated against the quine mandate—can it serialize to the wiki data object? Server-save compatibility must be preserved for any changes to the save mechanism.
  
  ## Governance
- <!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->
  
- [GOVERNANCE_RULES]
- <!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->

Perfect! I have successfully updated the Feather Wiki constitution. Let me provide you with a summary of what was accomplished:

## Constitution Update Summary

**New Version**: 1.0.0 (initial creation)  
**Version Bump Rationale**: This is the initial constitution creation for Feather Wiki, establishing the foundational governance principles.

### Key Principles Established:

1. **Self-Containment (Quine Mandate)**: Ensures Feather Wiki remains a portable single HTML file with all data serializing to the wiki data object (state.p)

2. **Server-Save Protocol**: Defines the exact mechanism for server detection (OPTIONS request with dav header) and save operations (PUT request with complete HTML output)

3. **Size & Efficiency (Parsimony Mandate)**: Mandates minimal vanilla JavaScript, reuse of existing styles/functions, and zero core dependencies

4. **Prohibited Breaking Changes**: Explicitly protects the OPTIONS/PUT request format, HTML output during save, and UI element consistency

### Files Updated:

✅ **`.specify/memory/constitution.md`** - Created new constitution with Feather Wiki-specific principles  
✅ **`.specify/templates/plan-template.md`** - Updated constitution check section with specific Feather Wiki validation criteria

### No Changes Needed:

- **`.specify/templates/spec-template.md`** - No constitution-specific content to update
- **`.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`** - No constitution-specific content to update

### Suggested Commit Message:

```
docs: establish constitution v1.0.0 (Feather Wiki server-saving preservation)

- Add self-containment mandate for single HTML file architecture
- Define server-save protocol with OPTIONS/PUT request specifications  
- Establish size & efficiency requirements for minimal vanilla JS
- Prohibit breaking changes to save mechanism and UI elements
- Update plan template with Feather Wiki-specific constitution checks
```

The constitution is now ready and all dependent templates have been updated to maintain consistency with the new governance principles.
